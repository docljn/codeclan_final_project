# Final project suggested briefs and technologies

## Aim

To consolidate what you have learned in a past module or to research and learn a new language or technology.

The final projects allows you to create ***anything*** you want to! Below are a number of optional briefs if you are looking for ideas and suggested technologies if you want to learn something new.

You can choose to work in groups, pairs, or on your own.

It may be that you don't get everything finished in the week. You'll be presenting as usual, but you can always continue to work on your projects after the course.

**Write an MVP and talk it through with an instructor before you start.**


## Optional Briefs

### React

React.js is a framework which makes updating DOM elements dynamically much easier than it is with vanilla JS. You could use it to build the front-end of an app, and combine it with the a backend or API of your choice.


### Rewrite a previous project in a different technology

The idea here is to use your knowledge and planning from a previous project as the starting point for rebuilding it in a new framework. For example:

- Rewrite a vanilla Javascript project in React
- Rewrite a React homework in Angular (or another JS framework)
- Integrate your Java project into an Android app.


## Learn a new technology or language

Create a project (with a theme of your choice) in a new language or technology.

> If you choose to use a technology which we have not covered on the course, there is no guarantee that there will be instructors with experience in it.



### Suggested Technologies

Here are a list of technologies that you could start looking at for the final project.

- A new JS framework (e.g. Angular)
- A new language (e.g. C# (ASP.NET Core) or Python)
- SASS
- Redux
- Rails

You can also choose any other technology you'd like to learn.


## Planning


Start by making a list of learning goals for the week and use this to help you decide what to work on.

### Apps

* As with all other previous projects, document [user needs](https://goo.gl/zHbfud) and [user journeys](https://goo.gl/zXkgtZ) if you can. It will help you plan the successful delivery and improve the final presentation of your project.
* Sketching and wireframing interfaces of your final project will allow you to test core concepts before the build.
* Think of your users and ask yourself: what is it that they want? Don't build features that no one would use.

##### Web Apps

* If you're building a web app, make sure that the content (HTML) and presentation layers (CSS) are separated.
* Think of web accessibility and make all HTML semantically correct (this is to do with nesting tags properly and using tags accordingly to their purpose).

### Something else?

* Research tutorials and resources. Are they up to date? Are they clear?
